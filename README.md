# origins-example-packs
Contains example data and resource packs for the Origins mod.

## List of examples:

`avian_subspecies`: Changes the name of the original Avians to "Avian: Harpy" and adds a new origin "Avian: Ra" which jumps higher instead of being faster.

`no_phantom`: Completely disables the Phantom origin.

`no_water_vision`: Removes the underwater vision power from the Merling.

`second_layer`: Adds another layer with all the default origins, allowing players to choose two origins simultaneously.
